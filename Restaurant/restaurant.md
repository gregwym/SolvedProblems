# Resturant

Problem source: <https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/may13/challenges/restaurant>

Martha is interviewing at Subway. One of the rounds of the interview requires her to cut a bread of size __l * b__ into smaller identical pieces such that each piece is a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece of bread.

## Input format

The first line is an integer T. T lines follow. Each line contains two space separated integers l and b which denotes length and the breadth of the bread.

## Output format

T lines. Each being the number of squares of maximum size.

## Constraints

```
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= l, b <= 1000
```

## Sample Input

```
2
2 2
6 9
```

## Sample Output

```
1
6
```

## Explanation

The 1st testcase is a bread whose original dimensions are of a square 2 * 2, the bread is uncut and hence the answer is 1. The 2nd testcase has a bread of size 6 * 9. We can cut it into 54 squares of size 1 * 1, 0 of size 2 * 2, 6 of size 3 * 3, 0 of size 4 * 4, 0 of size 5 * 5 and 0 of size 6 * 6. The minimum number of squares of maximum size that can cut is 6.
